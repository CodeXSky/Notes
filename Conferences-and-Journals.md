### Journals
* Cartography:
  * [Journal of Maps](http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/tjom20/current) is concerned with social and physical processes that take place on a geographical scale. Topics could include, for example, footfall in retail marketing, the spread of bird flu or location of geological faults, the common theme being the use of maps or spatial diagrams to advance understanding. Maps submitted MUST make a substantial contribution to knowledge in the field that is likely to be of broad interest to readers of the journal. Above all, to be published in the JoM is to demonstrate a unique line of enquiry which has required the use of maps or spatial diagrams, to have collected new data or added significant value to existing data and to present and communicate the findings adhering to high cartographic standards.
  * [Journal of Transport Geography](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-transport-geography/) is a leading interdisciplinary journal focusing on the geographical dimensions of transport, travel and mobility. It is international in its outlook, and welcomes both conceptual papers and theoretically-informed, empirically-oriented contributions on the movement of people, goods and/or information by any mode and at every geographical scale.

* Transportation:
  * [Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/transportation-research-part-c-emerging-technologies/) is high-quality, scholarly research that addresses development, applications, and implications, in the field of transportation, of emerging technologies from such fields as operations research, computer science, electronics, control systems, artificial intelligence, and telecommunications, among others. The interest is not in the individual technologies or methodologies per se, but in their ultimate implications for the planning, design, operation, control, management, maintenance and rehabilitation of transportation systems, services and components. Of particular interest are the impacts of emerging technologies on transportation system performance, in terms of level of service, capacity, safety, reliability, resource consumption and the environment, economics and finance, privacy, standards, and liability.
  * [Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board](http://trrjournalonline.trb.org/loi/trr) is one of the most cited and prolific transportation journals in the world, offering unparalleled depth and breadth in the coverage of transportation-related topics. TRR Journal publishes approximately 70 issues annually of outstanding, peer-reviewed papers presenting research findings in policy, planning, administration, economics and financing, operations, construction, design, maintenance, safety, and more, for all modes of transportation. This site provides electronic access to a full compilation of papers since the 1996 series.
  * [Research in Transportation Economics](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/research-in-transportation-economics/) is a journal devoted to the dissemination of high quality economics research in the field of transportation. The content covers a wide variety of topics relating to the economic aspects of transportation, government regulatory policies regarding transportation, and issues of concern to transportation industry planners. The unifying theme throughout the papers is the application of economic theory and/or applied economic methodologies to transportation questions. The ultimate goal of Research in Transportation Economics is to provide transportation researchers a valuable source of information useful in the formulation of transport policy and industry decision making.
  * [Transport Policy Journal](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/transport-policy/) Transport Policy is an international refereed journal aimed at bridging the gap between theory and practice in transport. Its subject areas reflect the concerns of policymakers in government, industry, voluntary organisations and the public at large, providing independent, original and rigorous analysis to understand how policy decisions have been taken, monitor their effects, and suggest how they may be improved. The journal covers the entire transport sector including all modes: land, sea and air; public and private; motorised and non-motorised; passenger and freight, including transport in the context of related sectors such as energy, housing, industry and planning. Policy concerns in transport are wide and cover safety, efficiency, economic development, local and global environmental impacts, energy, land-use, equity and access.
  * [Transportation](http://link.springer.com/journal/11116) focuses on issues of relevance to the formulation of policy, the preparation and evaluation of plans, and the day-to-day operational management of transport systems. It concerns itself with the policies and systems themselves, as well as with their impacts on and relationships with other aspects of the social, economic and physical environment. Although the transportation needs of cities and nations around the world differ in detail, there is much benefit to be derived by sharing research findings and practical experience. Transportation lends itself to information exchange by publishing carefully selected papers which advance the international fund of knowledge. Transportation is relevant to all parts of the world: industrialized, newly industrialized or developing. Its mission is simply to help improve the transportation of people and goods by bringing an improved understanding of the subject to the theorists, practitioners and policy makers who study it.
  * [Journal of Transportation and Land Use](https://jtlu.org/index.php/jtlu) publishes original inter-disciplinary papers on the interaction of transport and land use. Domains include: engineering, planning, modeling, behavior, economics, geography, regional science, sociology, architecture and design, network science, and complex systems.
  * [Journal of Public Transportation](http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/jpt/) is an international journal containing original research and case studies associated with various forms of public transportation and related transportation and policy issues. Topics are approached from a variety of academic disciplines, including economics, engineering, planning, and others, and include policy, methodological, technological, and financial aspects. Emphasis is placed on the identification of innovative solutions to transportation problems.
* Architecture:
  * [Avery Review](http://www.averyreview.com/) is an online journal dedicated to thinking about books, buildings, and other architectural media. We see the genres of the review and the critical essay as vital but still underutilized ways of exploring the ideas and problems that animate the field of architecture, and we hope to push these genres beyond their most familiar forms, whether journalistic or academic. Our aim is to explore the broader implications of a given object of discourse (whether text, film, exhibition, building, project, or urban environment). We are interested in reviews that test and expand the reviewer’s own intellectual commitments—theoretical, architectural, and political—through the work of others. The Avery Review will publish new essays monthly during the academic year.
  * [Volume](http://volumeproject.org/) is an independent magazine that sets the agenda for architecture and design. With going beyond architecture’s definition of ‘making buildings’ it reaches out for global views on designing environments, advocates broader attitudes to social structures, and reclaims the cultural and political significance of architecture. Created as a global idea platform to voice architecture any way, anywhere, anytime, it represents the expansion of architectural territories and the new mandate for design.
  * [Places](https://placesjournal.org/explore-places/) is an essential and trusted resource on the future of architecture, landscape, and urbanism. We harness the power of public scholarship to promote equitable cities and resilient landscapes. In these pages you will find writers, designers, and artists who are responding to the profound challenges of our time: environmental health and social inequity, climate change, resource scarcity, human migration, rapid technological innovation, and the erosion of the public sphere.
  * [Log](https://www.anycorp.com/log/about/) is an independent journal on architecture and the contemporary city that presents criticism and commentary in a literary format designed to resist the seductive power of the image in media while identifying and elaborating the central concerns of architectural thinking and production today. A carefully crafted compendium of essays, interviews, and brief "observations," Log provides an ongoing international platform for the exchange of ideas, both bearing on and emanating from architecture and the city, among a curious audience of readers, including architects, designers, students, scholars, and artists. Published three times a year, general "open" issues are punctuated by occasional thematic issues on prescient topics.
* Planning:
  * [Journal of the American Planning Association](https://www.planning.org/japa/) publishes research, commentaries, and book reviews useful to practicing planners, policy makers, scholars, students, and citizens of urban, suburban, and rural areas. JAPA publishes only peer-reviewed, original research and analysis. It aspires to bring insight to planning the future, to air a variety of perspectives, to publish the highest quality work, and to engage readers.
  * [Planning Practice and Research](http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/cppr20/current) established itself as the source for information on current research in planning practice. It is intended for reflective, critical academics, professionals and students who are concerned to keep abreast of and challenge current thinking. PPR is committed to: bridging the gaps between planning research, practice and education, and between different planning systems; providing a forum for an international readership to discuss and review research on planning practice; the critical evaluation of practice and the progressive search for practical guidance; presenting research in an accessible, succinct style, not overly theoretical, but analytical.
  * [Urban Studies](http://usj.sagepub.com/) is the leading international peer-reviewed journal for urban scholarship. Since its inception in 1964, the journal has remained at the forefront of intellectual and policy debates on the city, and has hosted ground-breaking contributions from across the full range of social science disciplines. The Editors aim to maintain and extend the role of Urban Studies as the journal of choice for those working on the cutting edge of academic research about cities. We welcome all original submissions that further our understanding of the urban condition and the rapid changes taking place in cities and regions across the globe, whether from an empirical, theoretical, or a policy perspective.
  * [Journal of Planning Education and Research](http://jpe.sagepub.com/) double-blind peer-reviewed and published quarterly, is a forum for planning educators and scholars (from both academia and practice) to present results from teaching and research that advance the profession and improve planning practice. The journal covers planning theory, planning practice, and planning pedagogy, as well as disciplines drawn upon by planners such as urban geography, welfare economics, interest-group politics, and policy analysis.
  * [Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science](http://journals.sagepub.com/home/epb) is the leading journal for the publication of high-quality articles that present cutting-edge research in analytical methods for urban planning and design. The journal focuses on smart cities, urban analytics, GIS, and urban simulation models. It also deals with visualisation, computation, and formal design-based methods applicable to morphological processes and structures in cities and regions.
  * [Urban Planning](http://www.cogitatiopress.com/urbanplanning/index) is a new international peer-reviewed open access journal of urban studies aimed at advancing understandings and ideas of humankind’s habitats – villages, towns, cities, megacities – in order to promote progress and quality of life. Numerous disciplines and perspectives are involved in the process of understanding urban phenomena. The journal is founded on the premise that qualitative linked to quantitative approaches provide mutually sympathetic outcomes for adding knowledge to the complex and polyhedral system par antonomasia as the city is. The journal brings urban science and urban planning together with other cross-disciplinary fields such as sociology, ecology, psychology, technology, politics, philosophy, geography, environmental science, economics, maths and computer science, to understand processes influencing urban forms and structures, their relations with environment and life quality, with the final aim to identify patterns towards progress and quality of life.

Broadly defined, digital and media literacy refer to the ability to access, share, analyze, create, reflect upon, and act with media and digital information.
  * [Public Journal](http://www.thisispublicjournal.com/) Journal provides an unprecedented platform for the expanding Public Interest Design movement; where the world of architecture intersects the voices of activism, exposing a determination to provide good design for those that need it most, but most often do not get it. Public is put together by an impassioned group of humanitarians in the fields of architecture, environmental design, and public policy change who are actively working to provide built projects to disadvantaged communities throughout the globe. Public features thought-provoking editorials and exceptional photography of meaningful projects that are improving lives. Our readers get insight into the social, political, and cultural issues that surround this burgeoning movement. PUBLIC tells stories of like-minded individuals attempting to make a difference and celebrates their challenges and successes, one project at a time. Today’s growing Public Interest Design movement deserves to be exposed and archived.
  * [Rhizomes](http://www.rhizomes.net/) oppose the idea that knowledge must grow in a tree structure from previously accepted ideas. New thinking need not follow established patterns. Rhizomes promotes experimental work located outside current disciplines, work that has no proper location. As our name suggests, works written in the spirit of Deleuzian approaches are welcomed but not required. We are not interested in publishing texts that establish their authority merely by affirming what is already believed. Instead, we encourage migrations into new conceptual territories resulting from unpredictable juxtapositions. **Open Access**
  * [Digital Creativity](http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/ndcr20/current) is a major peer-reviewed journal at the intersection of the creative arts and digital technologies.

We also welcome views from other disciplines that include, but are not limited to: psychology, sociology, engineering, various fields of technology, the hard sciences, and business. Each issue focuses on a special topic designed to encourage new interpretations and new possibilities. We abjure jargon, pandering, and ad hominem responses. Our ethos is brevity, clarity, and elegance. We do not accept fiction or poetry; we do accept images, videos, and sound recordings used in the presentation of notes. NANO welcomes creative reflections, spirited debate, and cross-disciplinary dialogue.
  * [Big Data & Society](http://journals.sagepub.com/home/bds) is an open access peer-reviewed scholarly journal that publishes interdisciplinary work principally in the social sciences, humanities and computing and their intersections with the arts and natural sciences about the implications of Big Data for societies.
