This assumes you've already signed-up for AWS and have access to the EC2 console.

### Setting Up the EC2 Instance
* Make sure the region is set to the nearest in your area. For New York City, the right region is _US East (N. Virginia)_.
* When you launch a new instance, make sure you create a key pair and download it. This key pair will allow you access to your instance.
